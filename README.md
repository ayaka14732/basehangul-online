## What is Hangul?

Hangul is the Korean writing system that consists of syllabic characters representing the sounds of the Korean language. It was created in the 15th century and is now the official script of Korea. Hangul is composed of individual characters called "jamo" that represent syllables and can be combined to form complex words.

## What is BaseHangul?

Similar to Base64, BaseHangul is a binary encoding that uses Hangul (Korean writing system) characters to represent binary data. It converts 5 bytes (40 bits) into 4 Hangul characters based on the KS C 5601 standard. The 40-bit conversion is chosen because it is the least common multiple of 8 and 10, which are the number of bits used to represent 1 character. 1028 Hangul characters out of 2350 in the standard are selected in dictionary order for the encoding. The character "Ìùê" is outside of the selected range but used as a padding character.
